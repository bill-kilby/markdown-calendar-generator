# Markdown Calendar Generator

A simple Python script that generates a directory of Markdown files, filtered by a folder for each month.

## Project Overview

This project allows calendars to be generated in the markdown language. It pulls from editable templates, and links days to a monthly recap, and months to a yearly recap.
This allows for cool graph generation when using programs such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or other Markdown text editors.

The script generates a directory named `./YEAR_Calendar` where `YEAR` is either 2024 or defined by the user in the command line (_see Execution for more information_).

Inside the `./YEAR_Calendar/` folder, each month is found within their respective folders. As well as this, a blank `YEAR_Recap.md` file can be found, which is the
final link for the rest of the calendar.

Inside each `./YEAR_Calendar/MONTH/` folder, where `MONTH` is the respective month, there is a `/Days/` folder, for the month's days' markdown files, as well as a
`MONTH_Recap.md` file, which is the link between the day markdown files, and the `YEAR_Recap.md` file. It also serves as an area for writing a recap for that month. 

Finally, inside each `.YEAR_Calendar/MONTH/Days/` folder, there are several `YYYY-MM-DD.md` files, with the amount being that of the month's days. The script 
automatically detects whether or not the specified year is a leap year. These files serve as an area for a daily recap, a day plan, or whatever you want to
note daily.
