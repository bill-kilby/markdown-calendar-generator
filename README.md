# Markdown Calendar Generator

A simple Python script that generates a directory of Markdown files from templates, filtered by a folder for each month.

## Project Overview

This project allows calendars to be generated in the markdown language. It pulls from editable templates, and links days to a monthly recap, and months to a yearly recap.
This allows for cool graph generation when using programs such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or other Markdown text editors.

The script generates a directory named `./YEAR_Calendar` where `YEAR` is either 2024 or defined by the user in the command line (_see Execution for more information_).

Inside the `./YEAR_Calendar/` folder, each month is found within their respective folders. As well as this, a blank `YEAR Recap.md` file can be found, which is the
final link for the rest of the calendar.

Inside each `./YEAR_Calendar/MONTH/` folder, where `MONTH` is the respective month, there is a `/Days/` folder, for the month's days' markdown files, as well as a
`MONTH Recap.md` file, which is the link between the day markdown files, and the `YEAR Recap.md` file. It also serves as an area for writing a recap for that month. 

Finally, inside each `.YEAR_Calendar/MONTH/Days/` folder, there are several `YYYY-MM-DD.md` files, with the amount being that of the month's days. The script 
automatically detects whether or not the specified year is a leap year. These files serve as an area for a daily recap, a day plan, or whatever you want to
note daily.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.11.3

### Installing

For just the calendar generation:
* Download the `create_markdown_calendar.py`, and `/templates/` folder.

If you are interested in the documentation:
* Sphinx documentation can be found under the `/docs/` folder, or [on my website.](https://billkilby.dev/docs/markdown_calendar_generator/index.html)

### Executing program

#### Running the script

* Firstly, drag the `create_markdown_calendar.py` and `/templates/` folder into the directory you want the calendar to be generated in.
* Then, run the script by executing the following line in the same directory as the script and templates.
```
python create_markdown_calendar.py
```
* Alternatively, you can run it with 2 arguments -> `YEAR` should be an integer, and `DEBUGMODE` either True or False.
  * `YEAR` is the year you want to generate the calendar for. By default, this is 2024.
  * `DEBUGMODE` will output certain print statements if set to True. By default, this is False.
```
python create_markdown_calendar.py YEAR DEBUGMODE
```

#### Editing the templates
Templates can be found under the `templates` directory. By default, they generate a placeholder for the body of text, a line break, and then an example introductory text.
There are only two restrictions to the templates:
* The first line will be the title of the file (YYYY-MM-DD).
* The final line will have a link to the parent added at the end of it, in the following format `FINAL_LINE + "[[PARENT LINK]]."`

*Please note that these restrictions do not affect the template files themselves, but are instead added during the file generation in the code.*

For example, a template of the following contents:
```
__Insert Content Here__
_______________________
To see the overall month: 
```
Will generate a final markdown file of the following contents:
```
YYYY-MM-DD
__Insert Content Here__
_______________________
To see the overall month: [[MONTH Recap]].
```

## FAQ

### Is there a pre-generated calendar?

Yes! There is a pre-generated 2024 calendar which can be found under `/2024_Calendar/`.
This uses the base templates, so may not be suitable for all applications, but should be
ideal for most uses.
